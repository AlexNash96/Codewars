# Codewars
This repo is a sample of Codewars challenges that I have completed. Some have been refactored, and some have had basic testing included.

Each folder contains one challenge from Codewars. The coding challenge that is presented can be found in the <challenge name>.md file in each folder. 
Each challenge has one .py file that is the solution to the challenge. Challenges with testing have all tests listed as test_<challenge name>.py.

All test_* files have been tested and validated using pytest
